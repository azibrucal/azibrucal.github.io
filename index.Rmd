I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science - Grantham Research Institute for Climate Change and the Environment. I am interested in applied econometrics with emphasis in the fields of environmental and energy economics and international trade. My research uses microdata to analyze the economics of household- and firm-level energy consumption and investment on energy-efficient technologies.  

Feel free to contact me.
